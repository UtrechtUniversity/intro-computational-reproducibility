# Introduction to Computational Reproducibility

_If you are looking at a GitHub README, please note that the slides are available via https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/intro-computational-reproducibility/)._

This is the GitHub repository containing the slides for an 1.5 hour Introduciton to Computational Reproducibility. 
This workshop is a short version of the full RDM Support workshop "Best Practices in Writing Reproducible Code". 
Information on that workshop can be found [on the RDM Support website](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/training-workshops/best-practices-for-writing-reproducible-code).

## Contents of this workshop (TODO: update this)

2. Project structure (Dorien, 5 mins)
3. Documentation (Dorien, 5 mins)
4. Code quality (Jelle, 5 mins)
