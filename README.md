## Exercises

### For people new to Git and GitHub
We learn to do some basic things with GitHub via the GitHub website.

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub account [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

#### Step 2: Go to this template repository and browse it: [github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-python-template](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-python-template)

#### Step 3: Clone the repository:

- Go back to the [main page](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/simple-python-template) of the repository and click the green 'Use this template' button. 
- A drop down menu will appear. Select 'Create a new repository'
- Choose a repository name, e.g. `my-first-github-repository`. If interested, read more on [repository naming conventions](https://climbtheladder.com/10-github-repository-naming-best-practices/)
- Choose 'public', which means everyone can see this repository
- Click 'Create repository'


# Step 4: Make a change to the README file
After creating the repository you automatically land on the main page of the repository that is findable under `github.com/<your profile name>/<your repository name>`. The page displays the contents of the repository and underneath the contents of the `README.md` file. We will now make a change to the README file.

- Click the pencil icon at the top right of the README file to edit the file.
